## Files Created

I've created the following essential files for SEO:

1. **robots.txt** - Tells search engines which pages to crawl
2. **sitemap.xml** - Lists all your website pages for search engines
3. **google-site-verification.html** - Template for Google Search Console verification

---

## Step-by-Step Google Search Console Setup

### 1. Upload Files to Your Website

Upload these files to the ROOT of your website:
- `robots.txt`
- `sitemap.xml`

They should be accessible at:
- https://nailtechmagicbyandrada.beauty/robots.txt
- https://nailtechmagicbyandrada.beauty/sitemap.xml

### 2. Set Up Google Search Console

**Go to:** https://search.google.com/search-console/

**Steps:**
1. Click "Start Now" or sign in with your Google account
2. Click "Add Property"
3. Choose "URL prefix" method
4. Enter: `https://nailtechmagicbyandrada.beauty`
5. Click "Continue"

### 3. Verify Your Website Ownership

Google will offer several verification methods. Choose one:

#### Option A: HTML Meta Tag (RECOMMENDED - Easiest)
1. Google will give you a meta tag like:
   ```html
   <meta name="google-site-verification" content="abc123xyz..." />
   ```
2. Copy this tag
3. Add it to the `<head>` section of your `index.html` file (after line 17)
4. Upload the updated `index.html` to your server
5. Go back to Google Search Console and click "Verify"

#### Option B: HTML File Upload
1. Download the verification file Google provides (e.g., `googleXXXXXXXX.html`)
2. Upload it to the root of your website
3. Click "Verify" in Google Search Console

#### Option C: DNS Verification (Advanced)
1. Add a TXT record to your domain's DNS settings
2. Use the code Google provides
3. Wait for DNS propagation (can take up to 48 hours)
4. Click "Verify"

### 4. Submit Your Sitemap

Once verified:
1. In Google Search Console, go to "Sitemaps" in the left menu
2. Enter `sitemap.xml` in the "Add a new sitemap" field
3. Click "Submit"

Google will now start crawling your website!

2. Create a new property
3. Get your measurement ID (e.g., G-XXXXXXXXXX)
4. Add this code to the `<head>` section of all pages:

```html
<!-- Google Analytics 4 -->
<script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=G-XXXXXXXXXX"></script>
<script>
  window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
  function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}
  gtag('js', new Date());
  gtag('config', 'G-XXXXXXXXXX');
</script>
```

### What to Monitor:
