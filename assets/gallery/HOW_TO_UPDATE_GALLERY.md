â”œâ”€â”€ gallery7.jpg - gallery11.jpg   âœ… (already real images)
â””â”€â”€ gallery12.jpg - gallery30.jpg  ðŸ”„ (REPLACE THESE 19 FILES)
```

**Important:** Keep the same filenames! Just replace the image content.

### Step 4: How to Replace

1. Download/save your 19 new images
2. Rename them to: `gallery12.jpg`, `gallery13.jpg`, ... `gallery30.jpg`
