# How to Tell Google About Your Website - Simple Steps

## üöÄ STEP 1: Upload Your Files (5 minutes)

You need to upload these 2 files to your website's root folder (where index.html is):

1. **robots.txt**
2. **sitemap.xml**

### How to Upload:
- Use FTP (FileZilla, Cyberduck, or your hosting's file manager)
- Upload to the SAME folder where `index.html` is located
- After upload, test by visiting:
  - https://nailtechmagicbyandrada.beauty/robots.txt
  - https://nailtechmagicbyandrada.beauty/sitemap.xml

**‚úÖ If you see text/XML when visiting these URLs, you're good!**

   ```

2. **Copy this entire line**

3. **Open your `index.html` file**

4. **Find this line** (around line 17):
   ```html
   <meta name="theme-color" content="#d4af37" />
   ```

5. **Add the Google verification line RIGHT AFTER it:**
   ```html
   <meta name="theme-color" content="#d4af37" />
   <meta name="google-site-verification" content="YOUR_CODE_HERE" />
   ```

6. **Save and upload** the updated `index.html` to your website
